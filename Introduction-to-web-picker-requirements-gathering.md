Hi,
 as a backer and advocate of Web Awesome and its idea of a quality framework‑agnostic library of open-source web components, I've been looking for ways to lend a hand. As a start, I've done a lot of research on data picker components, and have written up some guidance for the developers and community in selecting what capabilities it might best have.

First, as in all software engineering and especially in open source communities, let's be aware of what bike-shedding is, and consciously work to avoid it.

> Bikeshedding, also known as [Parkinson's Law of Triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality), is the tendency for groups to focus disproportionately on minor, easily understood issues while neglecting more complex, important ones. This is commonly seen in open source forums and requirements definition processes because people naturally feel more comfortable talking about simple, familiar ideas rather than wrestling with more challenging, nuanced problems.

The following comments are a pragmatic, "don’t-overbuild it" blueprint we can begin with to help us converge on the right calendar/date-picker for Web Awesome.
