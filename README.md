# Web Awesome date picker requirements gathering

My write up of guidance for the [Web Awesome](https://github.com/shoelace-style/webawesome) [OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) community and devs for writing the requirements for the date picker component.

> <sup>**What Is Web Awesome?**\
 **A major open‑source library**: Web Awesome bills itself as "the biggest open‑source library of meticulously designed, highly customizable, and framework‑agnostic UI components."</sup>\
> <sup>**Framework‑agnostic**: You can drop these components into plain HTML pages or integrate them seamlessly into frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.</sup>\
> <sup>**Built on modern standards**: The components are built with [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) and Google's [LitElement](https://lit.dev/docs/) lightweight library, ensuring they're native, modular, and performant.</sup>\
> <sup>**Accessibility and customization**: Designed to be accessible, fully themeable, and easily tuned to match your brand or style preferences.</sup>\
> <sup>Read more about Web Awesome here: [WebAwesome.com](https://webawesome.com/)</sup>
