# 4) Prioritize: Essential vs "most wanted" vs "nice-to-have"

**Suggested Essential (v1 "must ship")**

* APG-compliant (W3C WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide) keyboard & screen-reader behavior (dialog and/or combobox patterns).
* Single date **and** range selection.
* Min/max & disable rules (function-based)
* Multi-month (2) option, Month/Year fast nav.
* Locale + first-day-of-week. Formatting/parsing. RTL (Right-to-Left locales)
* Theming via tokens + CSS parts. Dark mode. High-contrast.
* Events for 'change/open/close/month-change/year-change'.
* Form integration: validation states, clear button, today shortcut.

**Suggested Most used / high impact (v1.1-v2)**

* Preset ranges. Hover range preview. Week numbers toggle.
* Commit semantics (confirm bar) for Enterprise forms.
* Inline mode + mobile-optimized modal variant.
